// Larger or Smaller?

// Usage: Use simple conditional statements

// Create an application that accepts two integers within two separate prompts. Then, display only the larger of the two within the browser window. Donâ€™t forget to handle the fact that the two could be equal.



// Ask user to enter two integer
let num1 = parseInt( prompt("Please enter first integer"));
let num2 = parseInt( prompt("Please enter second integer"));

if(num1 > num2){
    document.write(`two integers are ${num1} and ${num2} and the largest integer is ${num1}`);
}else if(num2 > num1){
    document.write(`two integers are ${num1} and ${num2} and largest integer is ${num2}`);
}else{
    document.write(`Two integers are equal ${num1}`);
}
